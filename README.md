# The website
## First draft - 3/3/2021
Simple HTML5 templates on this repository, powered by Github pages

As SK is having domain troubles, I've [forked this repo to my personal account](https://github.com/gizmotronn/st) with gh-pages enabled: https://gizmotronn.github.io/st/

## Second draft -
HTML5 templates ported over to a flask `templates` folder with routes defined from the first draft

# Requirements
Python/Flask:
* Flask
* Flask-sqlalchemy

# Technology
## Air filtration tech
[Interior Air Quality](https://www.scentechnologies.com/en/filtering-technology)
The main pollutants present inside an area can be grouped into two main categories: Particles (PM) and gases. Particles in the air vary in size, from a few nanometers (nm) to tens of micrometers (μm) and are Composed of biological and non-biological matter. The particles are commonly classified into:  

Coarse particles (PM10) from 10 µm to 2.5 µm in diameter.  

Fine particles (PM2.5) at 2.5 μm or smaller.  

Ultrafine particles at 1 μm (PM1) or smaller.  

Fine particles (PM2.5) in outdoor air are known to cause adverse effects on human health. In fact, particle pollution has been shown to exacerbate the incidence of COVID-19.  

Gaseous pollutants include organic (COVs) and inorganic compounds.

 How to Improve Interior Air Quality
The simplest and cheapest way to avoid indoor pollution is, of course, to avoid the activities that lead to it, such as smoking or cooking. However, since that is not always possible, the next best option is to thoroughly ventilate the space. This has a significant energy impact (the ambient air will have to be reheated or cooled) and is often not feasible (a room may open into the hallway of a shopping center). Also, opening windows in a city can lead to more pollution than can happen in cities.  

There are various types of air cleaning technologies:  

Fibrous media air filters remove particulates by capturing them in filter materials. Purification occurs when contaminants are trapped in the mesh formed by the fibers. It is a purely physical filter.  

Electrostatic filters and ionizers remove particles through an active electrostatic charge process that requires electricity, so they attract and adhere to oppositely charged plates or other interior surfaces. In this way, the contaminating particles adhere to the surfaces and can be cleaned by traditional physical means.  

Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) consists of passing a stream of air through a chamber illuminated with Ultraviolet C light. This kills or deactivates many microorganisms.  

Air filters with adsorbing media, such as activated carbon, that adsorb contaminants. These have the characteristic that they are capable of capturing molecular size contaminants, that is, they allow capturing nanometric size contaminants.

 Matters to bear in mind in Purification Systems
We have to define which pollutants we want to filter:  

Millimeters: size measured in millimeters.  

Micrometers: size measured in microns.  

Nanometers: size measured in nanometers.  

Commercial premises are generally open, so that they are subject to an elevated air renewal. For this reason, “clean room” level filtering level is not necessary when the doors are to be opened frequently and air and its respective pollutants are to enter from outside.  

Filters require regular maintenance. If regular maintenance is not carried out, the filter will no longer be effective at best. At worst, it will become a focus of infections.  

An air treatment system requires the air to move. Therefore, if we want to treat the air in a room, it is essential that there be a constant air impulsion system. 

Purifying the air requires energy. When choosing the system, we must take into account what was said in the previous point. Many locations do not run the air conditioning system because it consumes a lot of energy and is often not necessary when temperatures are not extreme. However, when the system is stopped, the filters it incorporates are no longer effective. Therefore, if we want to purify the air in our premises continuously, we need a system independent of the central A / C.  

Nighttime is a good time to clean the air. The doors are closed, pollutants are not generated and people do not enter. You have to take advantage of that time to get the cleanest air possible.
